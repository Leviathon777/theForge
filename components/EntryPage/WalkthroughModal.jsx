        'Step 5: After completing your investor profile, you will then be prompted to complete the KYC verification process. The KYC process can also be found in the dropdown VAULT ACTIONS in the FORGE area. This process is not yet mandatory to begin the investing process but is required for investing as an ETERNAL. This step validates your identity and ensures regulatory compliance across the globe. It is an important step that provides a deeper level of security and compliance.',

Note that TRANSAK will require a KYC process to use their services. To expedite the process, we have incorporated the same KYC group used by TRANSAK, enabling cross-platform acceptance of the KYC to eliminate multiple application points.',
        'Step 11: Once you have funded your wallet with the proper amount of BNB, you can then return to THE FORGE and begin the investing process with XDRIP Digital Management. Inside The Forge you choose the tier of MEDAL OF HONOR you are forging. Follow the wallet prompts to finalize your investment.',

If on mobile, you can find this app in the Apple or Google stores. Once installed, follow the directions to create a new wallet. Make sure to securely save your recovery phrase in a safe location accessible only to you. This is your access number to your bank account on the blockchain.',

For a guest option, a JSON file will be generated containing the necessary data for importing your wallet and will prompt you to save it to your local machine.',
